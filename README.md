# ServerClientSimple

The client asks the user for the number of the character to be changed and the symbol to which the replacement is to be made. The client sends the entered data to the server. The server accesses the file (file on the server, in the file a set of sentences), takes a sentence from the file and replaces each K character in the word with a new one (which it received from the client). The server sends the changed proposal to the client and the client writes the result to a file (a separate file that is stored on the client side)
